- Create a Triangle class.
- Write a command line interface that allows users to input lengths for the 3 sides.
- Create a Triangle object using these lengths.
- Write a method in the Triangle class that returns whether the lengths form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle. If you're not familiar with these terms, here are definitions:
 	- Equilateral: All sides are equal.
 	- Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
 	- Scalene: No sides are equal.
 	- Invalid triangle if any one side is longer than the other two combined
